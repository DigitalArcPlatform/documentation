# Planning Committee

To begin the planning process for a community archiving event, organizers will want to consider convening a planning committee to assist in the planning and execution of this event. This will help divide the work among other interested parties. When selecting members for the planning committee, consider previous community events and prioritize individuals who assisted in the planning process of those events. Although previous event planning is not necessary, having some experience will aid in the organization of the archiving event.


#Roles

Once interested parties have been identified, you will want to assign roles and responsibilities to each member of the planning committee. This will allow volunteers to take ownership of a particular area of the event, and they will be the point of contact for that area. In determining each member’s role, the committee may consider an individual’s strengths and interests and make decisions based on this information. You may also consider the interpersonal relationships between each member when making decisions about roles. 


Some possible roles and responsibilities can include: 

1.  Lead Organizer
  - Provide overall guidance for the event
  - Collaborate with the planning committee to discuss needs for the event and assist where needed
  - Communicate with community members to generate interest and enthusiasm for the event
2.  Outreach Coordinator
3. Volunteer Coordinator
