# Planning Committee

To begin the planning process for a community archiving event, organizers will want to consider convening a planning committee to assist in the planning and execution of this event. This will help divide the work among other interested parties. When selecting members for the planning committee, consider previous community events and prioritize individuals who assisted in the planning process of those events. Although previous event planning is not necessary, having some experience will aid in the organization of the archiving event.
