# File Naming

In order to more easily keep track of the numerous photographs and audio files from a community history gathering event, it will be essential to have a system for standardizing file names. 

If you have followed the system of Object ID stickers which we present in the [Pre-Event Setup]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/preEvent/preEvent.html) section, this will simplify the process.

In short, we recommend the following system for naming your files: 

- YYYY-MM-DD is the date on which the event is hosted
- XXXX denotes the order in which that items were collected (i.e. 0001 is the first item, 0002 is the second, etc.) 

Hence 2024-03-21-0004 would correspond to the fourth item collected on March 21st, 2024.

## General Guidelines

Should you wish to use a different naming system, it is important to keep the following guidelines in mind:

-	Are the filenames easily identifiable?
-	Are they easily searchable?
-	Are they easy for volunteers of different types to make sense of?
