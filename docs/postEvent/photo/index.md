# Resources & Best Practices for Photography Cleanup 

Photos and other forms of visual culture (objects of a variety of media in our society) carry a lot of information. For memory preservation, archivists try to retain as much of that visual information as possible, and photography is one tool for doing so. Summarized below, these fundamental techniques will help you to make your digital archive legible to future generations and people outside of your community. 

**TIP:** Think of yourself as a photojournalist who is communicating information through photography, not an artist who is expressing herself. 

You can edit photos without downloading any external software, such as Photoshop. These external links explain how to edit photos:

| Photo Editing Dos | Photo Editing Don'ts |
|---|---|
| Crop your image to focus on the subject, edit out distracting objects, but use your best judgment. | Don’t edit, crop, or blur out the image so much that it becomes misleading. |
| Save as .jpg or .png. | Don't save as HEIC or PDF. |
| Use a naming convention (such as YYYY-MM-DD-####) and consider automating this process. | Don’t use photos from the internet or other sources that do not come from you, your collaborators, or the participants in the history harvests. |
| Blur out sensitive material such as mailing or email addresses. | Don't use filters. |
| Remember what folder you save it in. | Don’t disrupt the aspect ratio. |
| Rotate the photo to make horizon lines and other straight lines straighter and to gently crop it. | That is, don’t stretch or shrink your image; sometimes this is mistaken for cropping. |

Remember that every detail in a photograph or a photo of an object—the framing, subject, any signs of damage, use of color, posing, etc.—opens new avenues for asking questions that lead to remembering the past and/or research. Your aim should not be to make the photos “beautiful,” but rather to honor their complexities by striving for objectivity in your editing. Always use your best judgment and remember that your approach for editing your archive can also be analyzed, not just the photograph itself.  

# Step-by-Step Instructions

This document walks through the best practices for editing and cleaning photographs that were collected during the day-of collection event.  

This is broken down into five sections: 

1. Batch processing photo cleanup with [Photoshop](#batch-processing-with-photoshop)
1. Manually cleaning photos on a [Mac](#photo-cleanup-on-a-mac-computer) computer
1. Manually cleaning photos on a [Windows](#photo-cleanup-on-a-windows-computer) computer
1. Manually cleaning photos with an [iPhone](#photo-cleanup-with-an-iphone)
1. Manually cleaning photos with an [Android](#photo-cleanup-with-an-android)

## Batch Processing with Photoshop

If you have access to Photoshop, this section covers how to clean the photos from the collection event in a batch process. This means that the edits you make will be applied to all the photos in the collection at one time, which should eliminate time spent on photo cleanup.  

### How to Download a Folder of Images 

This section covers how to download the whole folder of photos from the collection event. 

1. Click on the three dots next to the folder name 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/download1.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Select "Download"

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/download2.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Locate the folder on your local computer. By default, this will be in your Downloads folder. The folder will be saved as a .zip file.

### How to Open a Zip file

Locate the zip file on your local computer. By default, this will be in your Downloads folder. If you double-click the zip file, it will automatically open the file and create a folder for your photos. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/macZip1.png)

### How to Batch Resize Photos 

Your photos may vary in size, and this might impact your ultimate output onto the digital community archive. Batch photo resizing can ensure that all photos are similar pixel length and will appear similarly sized on the digital archive.

1. Open Adobe Photoshop. Choose File > Scripts > Image Processor. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/batch1.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. A dialog box will appear. In the section labeled “1- Select the images to process”, click the “Select Folder…” button, then navigate to your chosen folder in the pop-up window below. Click “Open” in the bottom right corner.

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/batch2.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. In the section labeled “2- Select location to save processed images”, Select the location for the saved processed photos. If you choose “Save in Same Location”, Photoshop will create a subfolder in that original location. If there is already a subfolder with the same name, Photoshop will add a number to the new subfolder to differentiate it from the original. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/batch3.png) 

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. In section 3, "File Type," we recommend that you save the files as JPEGs. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/batch4.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. In section 4, "Preferences," on the right hand side of the section, click "Resize to Fit," then set the resizing parameters to 1500 for both W and H 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/batch5.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Click the "Run" button in the upper right corner of the Image Processor window. Photoshop will open, resize, and save each image based on the parameters you set in the script. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/batch6.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Review your resized files by navigating to the location or folder where you chose to save your outputs. 

## Photo Cleanup on a Mac Computer 

If you do not have access to Photoshop or software that will batch process the photos from the collection event, no worries, you can still do all the necessary cleaning on a Windows or Mac computer. This section will cover how to clean photos manually on a Windows computer.  

### How to Download an Image 

If you will only be editing a few photos from the collection event, this section covers how to individually download photos that need cleaning.

**Note:** The screen captures used during this section are from Google Drive and will use an arbitrary Object ID, used to show the file naming convention suggested earlier in this guide. 

The steps are as follows to download an image: 

1. Click on the three dots next to the file name 
1. Select "Download" 
1. Locate the file on your local computer. By default, this will be in your Downloads folder.

1. Go to the "Photos" application on your Mac 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/import1.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Go to File > Import and select the folder of the photos from your downloads 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/import2.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}

### How to Open an Image for Editing 

Now that you have imported the images into the Photos application, you can now begin editing.

First, open the first image in the folder (or the image you would like to edit). You can do this by double-clicking on the image. Click on the "Edit" button, which is in the top right. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/macEdit1.png)

#### Crop

You should first consider cropping the image if it is off-center or contains unnecessary space. This can be achieved by selecting the “Crop” button at the top of the screen. From there, you can manipulate all four sides of the image by hovering the mouse over the selected edge and then clicking and dragging the edge to the desired cut-off point.  

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/macEdit2.png)

#### Brighten

Next, try playing around with the lightness/darkness of the image by toggling to the “Adjust” button at the top of the screen. A menu on the right should appear, and “Light” should be the first option that appears at the top of the menu. You can adjust the lighting by dragging the bar in the middle towards the left or right.  In some cases, images from the collection event could use more lighting, and making the photo brighter could enhance details from the object that was donated to the digital archive.

### Saving and Uploading the Final Version 

Once you have finished editing the photo, be sure to click the yellow "Done" button in the top right corner. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/macEdit4.png)

After you have repeated this process for all the other photos that need to be edited, you will want to re-upload the photos to the same place where you kept the originals. 

1. Select all of the photos from the day-of collection, whether edited or not. All photos should be in the folder.
1. Click File > Export > Export Folder. You can save the export anywhere on your local device. By default, it will save the folder to your desktop. 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/postEvent/photo/macUpload1.png)

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Locate the folder of edited photos.
