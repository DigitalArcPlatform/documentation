# Content Editing

In addition to the transcription of any oral history components, you will also want to consider how your photos will be contextualized once/if they are posted to your website. 

Much like a museum plaque, having text to accompany the images can make their importance more clear to potential readers. 

## Object Summary

Consider having a single paragraph in which you explain the history of the item and the importance of the item to both the contributor and the overall project. 

Consider also including and particularly relevant quotes from the transcription (if the contributor has given the appropriate permission).

## Unique Details

Depending on the size and scope of your history gathering event, you may also consider adding more detailed exhibit text that works with a larger theme. 

For instance, a history gathering event focused on an educational institution could warrant exhibit text that focuses on how certain items have been used in the broader context of education, or any possible nostalgic details. 

In other words, the objective is to leave the reader with an understanding of why this object matters not just to the contributor, but to *them* as well.
