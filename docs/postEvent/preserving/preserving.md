# Preserving Files

After your event, you will likely have a large number of high resolution images. When it comes time to create the website, you will likely need to use lower resolution versions of these images instead. 

The purpose of this section is to outline how to manage these files, and specifically how to preserve the high resolution versions so that they can be sent to participants. 

For more on sending out these images, see [**Sharing Files**]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/postEvent/preserving/preserving.html).

## Keeping the Originals 

Before you begin sharing image/audio files or downscaling them for your website, ** be sure to keep copies of the originals. ** 

This can be either in a Google Drive, flash drive, or external hard drive depending on the amount and size of your files.

When it comes time to edit or otherwise manipulate the files, be sure to copy the files first. ** The originals should stay intact. **
