# Walkthrough/How-To Day-Of Event Planning 

The objective of this section is to summarize how contributors make their way through the event, from Check-In to Check-Out.

A few preliminary items you should consider are: 

-	Do you have access to the floorplan before setting up equipment? 
-	Are all your intended station locations accessible for contributors? 
-	Are there any other possible sources of inteference in the vicinity?

## Check-In 

Since the check-in table will be contributors' first stop, there should be clear and identifiable signage, as well as at least one greeter to staff the station at any given time. 

## Technology Stations 

Depending on the scale of your event, the exact setup for your technology stations may vary.
For instance, if you anticipate a larger quantity of video content than photography, think about increasing the number of video stations. 

### Video Digitization Station 

If someone is contributing video, this will be the first stop of the technology-related stations since it is the most time consuming. 

### Photography Station

If a contributor has any photography needs, then this will be the next stop. 

## Oral History Interview Station

Subsequently, contributors will head to the oral history station if they have any such content to contribute. 

## Check-Out 

This is the final station which contributors pass through.
