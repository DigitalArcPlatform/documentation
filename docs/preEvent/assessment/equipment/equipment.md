# Equipment

We take a DIY approach to capturing stories using devices that are readily available like mobile smart phones or tablets, aiming for the best quality capture even if they may not meet digital archival standards. This work does not preclude using digital cameras, flatbed scanners or professional audio recorders that are able to capture content at a higher resolution. Nor does it preclude using a combination approach. 

Much will depend on access to equipment, training opportunities, and the community archiving event setting. Our documentation is largely geared toward using smartphones for capture.

In order to make sure that your event proceeds smoothly, plan **all** of your equipment needs well in advance. The lists below are not comprehensive, but do cover a wide array of materials that you will likely need for running your event. Be sure to consult your [Venue]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/preEvent/assessment/venue/venue.html) to see what equipment needs you will need to meet yourself.
