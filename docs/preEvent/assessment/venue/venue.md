# Venue

Two of the first essential steps in the event-planning process are selecting and securing a venue. This should happen *early* in the planning period. 
When choosing a venue, it is important to select a space that is physically accessible for all participants. If your venue is in a building with multiple floors, ensure that elevators are functioning and all ramps are unobstructed. 

Additionally, you'll want to make sure your chosen venue has the following requirements: 

1. A check-in/check-out area large enough to hold ~20 people
	- There should be plenty of space for the check-in/out stations and for people to enter and not feel rushed.

1. For digitization, you'll need a table or other flat surface to set up lightbox photography. 
1. A quiet room to conduct oral history interviews 
	- The goal is to limit background noise from the other event activities.
