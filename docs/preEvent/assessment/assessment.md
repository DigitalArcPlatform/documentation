# Assessment

It is critical to have an accurate assessment of all the moving parts of your history collection event. This includes a variety of details such as having the appropriate number and types of guides, the requisite equipment, and an accurate understanding of the venue (layout, parking accomodations, etc.).

The pages provided here are meant to assist you in thinking through these considerations and to provide examples and ideas for planning your event.

As always, **your needs may differ from exactly what we present here; plan accordingly.**
