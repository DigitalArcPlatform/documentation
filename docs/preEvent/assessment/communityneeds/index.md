# Gathering Community Needs

Now that you and your community have decided to continue with a community archiving event, the next steps are to understand better the community’s wants and needs for the event. Also, you will want to gather information about community members’ skills and availability for the event.  

The first assessment gathers information about the type of stories your community would like to share and the objects they own and would like to contribute to the archive.

You can circulate this sample survey with your community. We recommend using similar questions when creating a survey for your community.  

Once community members have completed this initial survey, you will better understand the types of stories your community is interested in sharing and the type of material or objects members would like to contribute to the archive. This will help you better plan for the archiving event, such as logistical decisions, the size of the venue, and the number of volunteers needed. It will also help you decide on the equipment you will need to digitize the objects and record the stories.  

# Establishing Community Values for Online Storytelling

Community archives rebalance authority, value lived experience, and create a more liberatory, participatory archival process. Considering how your community stories will be represented ahead of time can help you craft an oral-history interview approach that better represents community values in the final digital archive.

Every digital archive object will have a web page. Prepping in advance for some of the topics that are likely to come up can help your community control how the community archive shows up in online searches. *We'll come back to this twice, once in the Oral History section of the during-event process and again in the "Metadata" section of the post-event process.*

1. Start with shared values and relationship building
	1. Build trust, and think about how people outside your community will find you online,  in plain accessible language, discuss why it matters, and co-define goals for describing materials
1. Develop a collaborative set of oral history prompts that can help describe community contributions effectively:
	1. Title
		1. Prompt: "What would you call this item?"
		1. Intention: Community defined naming
	1. Description 
		1. Prompt: "Tell us the story behind this."
		1. Intention: Centering personal meaning 
	1. Date
		1. Prompt: "When was this from? Approximate is okay."
		1. Intention: Valuing memory over precision
	1. People
		1. Prompt: "Who is in this photo/story?"
		1. Intention: Naming and honoring individuals
	1. Place
		1. Prompt: "Where did this take place?"
		1. Intention: Grounding materials in place 
	1. Emotions/Significance
		1. Prompt: "How does this item make you feel?"
		1. Intention: Centering effect and cultural value
	1. Permissions
		1. Prompt: "How should this item be used/shared?"
		1. Intention: Honoring agency and consent
	1. Tags/Keywords
		1. Prompt: "What words would help people find this?"
		1. Intention: Enabling community-generated vocabularies 
1. Suggestions for Facilitation
	1. Get in pairs
	1. Listen deeply, write down stories, ask clarifying questions
	1. Treat storytelling as metadata
	1. Record audio or video if that captures richer metadata than text alone

# Assessing Community Skills and Availability

The second assessment gathers information about the skills and availability of community members willing to help organize the event. This information will help you manage volunteers and help you make decisions about assignments for volunteers. You can send this survey at the same time as sending out the first survey, or you can wait until after the first survey and incorporate the results of the first survey into the volunteer survey.
