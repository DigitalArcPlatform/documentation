# Pre-Event Planning

In order to quickly and easily facilitate your community archive event, there are a number of items you will need to make sure are in place. 

## Sign-In Form 

You will need some sort of form in order to collect information from the contributors about their items, contact information, and permission preference.

For user-friendliness on both your and the contributors' ends, we recommend using Google Forms as it is an interface with which the general public is generally familiar and it allows you to export the responses to a spreadsheet. 

## Object ID Stickers 

It will also help to have Object ID stickers created in advance. These stickers will allow both you and the contributors to keep track of their individual items. 

For ease of use, we recommend following the format YYYY-MM-DD-XXXX where:

- YYYY-MM-DD is the date on which the event is hosted
- XXXX denotes the order in which that items were collected (i.e. 0001 is the first item, 0002 is the second, etc.) 

Hence 2024-03-21-0004 would correspond to the fourth item collected on March 21st, 2024.

You will likely want to prepare a surplus of these stickers so as to avoid any disruptions during the course of the event. 

**NOTE:** These IDs will also be essential for assigning [file names]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/postEvent/naming/naming.html) in the aftermath of the history gathering event.
