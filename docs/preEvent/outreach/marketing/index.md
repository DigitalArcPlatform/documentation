# Marketing

There are a few ways you can go about marketing your event. You can promote it through social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), email listservs, organizational newsletters, or other publications which reach your intended audience. 
For each of these modes of communication, we have found that a digital flyer that contains all of the event details has been highly effective.
*Be sure to choose fonts and colors that are easy to read and visually engaging. The goal is to attract attention!*

## Flyer Design

Your flyer should include the following information, as well as any other relevant information: 

1. Title of the Event
{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Date, Time, and Location of the Event
{:style="counter-reset:none"} 
1. Who/What is hosting the Event 
{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Brief Event Description (2-4 sentences maximum)
	*The goal is to explain why the event is being hosted and what attendees can expect; save longer descriptions for social media, emails, etc.
{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. Any important logistical instructions (i.e. parking instructions, etc.)
1. What to bring (objects, images, videos, stories, memories, etc.)
1. Contact Information (phone number and/or email) for any questions or concerns 

## Sample Flyer 

We have included a barebones example of how you can consider organization the information above into a flyer: 

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/preEvent/marketing/marketingFlyer.png)

For your own flyer, consider including any relevant images or logos for your organization.
