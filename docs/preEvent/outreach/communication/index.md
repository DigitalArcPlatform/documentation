# Communication

The best ways to publicize your event will depend on your audience and their preferred forms of communication. If your organization has a newsletter or recurring publication, consider beginning there. Other modes of communication may include social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), email listservs, or posting printed flyers on community event boards. 

**Be sure to include all essential information about the event (see [**Marketing**](({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{site.imageurl}}/preEvent/outreach/marketing/marketing.html)) as well as contact information for any questions or concerns. 

For best results, *start promoting your event early!* Getting the information circulating 6 - 8 weeks ahead of the event date will provide plenty of time for participants to put it on their calendars, think about their contributions to the archive, collect their items, and invite others who may be interested.
