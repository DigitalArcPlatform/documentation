# Uploading Photos During The Event

As time permits between photo shoots and/or the end of your event, **be sure to upload all photos** to your digital storage platform of choice. 

Additionally, if using a cell-phone camera, **make sure to track storage capacity on any cell-phones used**. Not everyone will have unlimited storage on their phones, so you may need to periodically stop to upload images, even if there is a line of people waiting for photos. You can explain to the contributor and guide that you need a moment to upload. 

**Verify that all the images have uploaded fully** before deleting any images from your device, especially when doing so to make additional space. 


## Uploading photos to Google Drive on an iOS Phone

1.	In the Google Drive app on your phone, find the folder you are using for photo storage.
2.	The app will ask you whether you want to “Allow Full Access” or “Limit Access” to your Camera Roll. We recommend that you Allow Full Access to more easily upload older images in your photo library. 
3.	In the “Photographs” folder, click on the + (bottom right) to add images to this folder.
	1.	Select “Upload file”
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.imageurl }}/duringEvent/digital/Photographs_iPhone_Folder.png)
	2.	Select “Photos and Videos”
	3.	Select “Recents”<br>
	4.	Select one or more files (click on photo, blue checkmark will appear)<br>

	5.	Select “Upload”<br>
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.imageurl }}/duringEvent/digital/Photographs_iPhone_Upload.png)
	6.	Your images should now be visible in the shared “Photographs” folder.

**VERIFY that all the images uploaded fully before you delete images from your phone.**

	2. Depending on the model of Android you use, you may not have a “Recent” folder. If this is the case, in the same file explorer navigate to “Images” (in the above screenshot) and then select the folder titled “Camera”. From here, you can select the image.
