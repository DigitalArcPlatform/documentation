# Uploading Photos During The Event

As time permits between photo shoots and/or the end of your event, **be sure to upload all photos** to your digital storage platform of choice. 

Additionally, if using a cell-phone camera, **make sure to track storage capacity on any cell-phones used**. Not everyone will have unlimited storage on their phones, so you may need to periodically stop to upload images, even if there is a line of people waiting for photos. You can explain to the contributor and guide that you need a moment to upload. 

**Verify that all the images have uploaded fully** before deleting any images from your device, especially when doing so to make additional space. 


## Uploading photos to Google Drive on an iOS Phone

1.	In the Google Drive app on your phone, find the folder you are using for photo storage.
2.	The app will ask you whether you want to “Allow Full Access” or “Limit Access” to your Camera Roll. We recommend that you Allow Full Access to more easily upload older images in your photo library. 
3.	In the “Photographs” folder, click on the + (bottom right) to add images to this folder.
	1.	Select “Upload file”
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.imageurl }}/duringEvent/digital/Photographs_iPhone_Folder.png)
	2.	Select “Photos and Videos”
	3.	Select “Recents”<br>
	4.	Select one or more files (click on photo, blue checkmark will appear)<br>
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.imageurl }}/duringEvent/digital/Photographs_iPhone_MultiSelect.jpg)
	5.	Select “Upload”<br>
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.imageurl }}/duringEvent/digital/Photographs_iPhone_Upload.png)
	6.	Your images should now be visible in the shared “Photographs” folder.

**VERIFY that all the images uploaded fully before you delete images from your phone.**

# Uploading Audio During the Event 

As time permits between oral histories and/or at the end of the event, ** make sure to upload all the audio recordings you took** to the folder that you have designated for these interviews. 

**Make sure to track storage space on your phone.** Not everyone will have unlimited physical or cloud storage on their devices, so you may need to periodically stop in-between oral history interviews to upload audio files, even if you have people waiting to be interviewed. You can explain to the contributor and guide that you need a moment to upload the file(s). As always, **VERIFY that all the audio files uploaded in full** before you delete recordings from your phone, especially when freeing up space.
