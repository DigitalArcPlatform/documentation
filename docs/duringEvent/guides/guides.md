# Guides

Guides will walk contributors through the process, from check-in through checkout. They will need to be familiar with the whole process and will have prompts for the different stations. For this role, the volunteer should be comfortable with interpersonal communication.

Note that the order in which guides will visit the various stations will depend on:
- Whether the contributor has a video/non-video object to digitize
- If a video, the estimated length of the video

Guide will also be instrumental in helping contributors handle **born-digital files** (i.e. born-digital photos as objects, portraits, images from the internet as part of an oral history without accompanying artifact). For more on the digitization process, see [Digitization and Photography]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/duringEvent/digital.html).
