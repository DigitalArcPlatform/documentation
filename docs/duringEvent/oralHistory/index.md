# Oral History Interviews

The length of your Oral History Interviews will vary according to the objectives of your event and your technical & storage capacity. If the oral history is tied to a particular object, the majority of the relevant details can be covered in an interview no longer than 5-10 minutes. 

1. If the contributor has multiple items, begin with the **lowest** ID number and move sequentially for each interview. 
1. Check the contributor's sticker for their permissions(ANON, NA, etc.); reassure them that you will respect their selection.
	- If no audio (NA): Audio will be used only for transcription purposes. Transcribe and **delete** the audio. 
	- If anonymous (ANON): De-identify the interview before posting it, and the "contributor" information on the website will say "Anonymous Contributor"
	- If personal use (PRIV): Do **NOT** use the interview on the community archive website. Send the contributor the recording along with the digitized object for their personal archives.

## Interview Recording Protocol

Once you have selected your recording device (see below), the actual contents of your recording will follow a standard set of questions. 

1. To begin the interview, the interviewer should state their name and the contributor's Object ID. For example: 
	- "My name is _________ and I am interviewing the community member who contributed **(Object ID)** as part of **(Event Name)**."

1. If the contributor is basing their oral history on an artifact, ask the following questions, but be aware of the length of the interview:
	- What is the name of your object? 
	- When and where did you acquire it? (What year, city, etc.)
	- What is the date of the item's creation? 
	- How would you physically describe your object? 
	- What is the object's significance? 
	- When you see this object, what kind of memories does it recall? 
	- Is there anything I didn't ask you about this object that you would like to talk about? 

1. If the contributor is basing their oral history on a photo or other image which conveys the topic they would like to discuss, ask the following questions: 
	- Which memory would you like to share with us today? 
	- Why is this memory significant to you?
	- How does this memory relate to your identity? 
	- Is there anything I didn't ask that you would like to talk about?

## Uploading the Audio Recordings

As time permits between oral historiesphoto shoots and/or at the end of the event, make sure to upload all the audio recordings you took to the “Interviews” Google folder (login gmail or gmail-affiliated credentials). Follow -the setup instructions to get Google Drive installed on your phone and ready to handle the transfer of the audio files.

*Make sure to track storage on your phones.* Not all of us will have unlimited space on our phones so you may need to periodically stop in-between oral history interviews to upload audio files, even if you have a line of people waiting to be interviewed. You can explain to the contributor and the guide that you need a moment to upload. VERIFY that all the audio files uploaded in full before you delete recordingsimages from your phone, especially if you need to make space.

*Make sure to track the battery usage on your phone.*
