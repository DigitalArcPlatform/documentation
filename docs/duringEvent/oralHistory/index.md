# Oral History Interviews

The length of your Oral History Interviews will vary according to the objectives of your event and your technical & storage capacity. If the oral history is tied to a particular object, the majority of the relevant details can be covered in an interview no longer than 5-10 minutes. 

1. If the contributor has multiple items, begin with the **lowest** ID number and move sequentially for each interview. 
1. Check the contributor's sticker for their permissions(ANON, NA, etc.); reassure them that you will respect their selection.
	- If no audio (NA): Audio will be used only for transcription purposes. Transcribe and **delete** the audio. 
	- If anonymous (ANON): De-identify the interview before posting it, and the "contributor" information on the website will say "Anonymous Contributor"
	- If personal use (PRIV): Do **NOT** use the interview on the community archive website. Send the contributor the recording along with the digitized object for their personal archives.

## Story-telling as Metadata

Before you begin gathering oral histories, it is worth sitting down with community members and being intentional about the kinds of questions you intend to ask. This is because the information you gain from these oral history interviews will be a *major* source for your eventual [metadata]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/postEvent/metadata/#community-conversations-about-object-descriptions). Be sure to customize your interview questions to reflect the values and priorities of your community.  
	
## Interview Recording Protocol

Once you have selected your recording device (see below), the actual contents of your recording will follow a standard set of questions.

***For interviewers:** Consider writing down timestamps (in the context of the interview, rather than using clock time) during the interview, to highlight moments that have a particularly great story, or where the transcription might be difficult to transcribe. (Suggestion courtesy of S. Love, Gary, IN.)*

1. To begin the interview, the interviewer should state their name and the contributor's Object ID. For example: 
	- "My name is _________ and I am interviewing the community member who contributed **(Object ID)** as part of **(Event Name)**."

1. If the contributor is basing their oral history on an artifact, ask the following questions, but be aware of the length of the interview:
	- What is the name of your object? 
	- When and where did you acquire it? (What year, city, etc.)
	- What is the date of the item's creation? 
	- How would you physically describe your object? 
	- What is the object's significance? 
	- When you see this object, what kind of memories does it recall? 
	- Is there anything I didn't ask you about this object that you would like to talk about? 

1. If the contributor is basing their oral history on a photo or other image which conveys the topic they would like to discuss, ask the following questions: 
	- Which memory would you like to share with us today? 
	- Why is this memory significant to you?
	- How does this memory relate to your identity? 
	- Is there anything I didn't ask that you would like to talk about? 
	
### Remember Your Intentions

Community archives rebalance authority, value lived experience, and create a more liberatory, participatory archival process. Considering how your community stories will be represented ahead of time can help you craft an oral-history interview approach that better represents community values in the final digital archive.

Every digital archive object will have a web page. Remember that these interviews can help your community control how the community archive shows up in online searches. *We'll come back to this again, in the "Metadata" section of the post-event process.*

1. Remember your collaborative set of oral history prompts and how that can help describe community contributions effectively:
	1. Title
		1. Prompt: "What would you call this item?"
		1. Intention: Community defined naming
	1. Description 
		1. Prompt: "Tell us the story behind this."
		1. Intention: Centering personal meaning 
	1. Date
		1. Prompt: "When was this from? Approximate is okay."
		1. Intention: Valuing memory over precision
	1. People
		1. Prompt: "Who is in this photo/story?"
		1. Intention: Naming and honoring individuals
	1. Place
		1. Prompt: "Where did this take place?"
		1. Intention: Grounding materials in place 
	1. Emotions/Significance
		1. Prompt: "How does this item make you feel?"
		1. Intention: Centering effect and cultural value
	1. Permissions
		1. Prompt: "How should this item be used/shared?"
		1. Intention: Honoring agency and consent
	1. Tags/Keywords
		1. Prompt: "What words would help people find this?"
		1. Intention: Enabling community-generated vocabularies

## Uploading the Audio Recordings

As time permits between oral histories, and/or at the end of the event, make sure to upload all the audio recordings you took to the “Interviews” Google folder (login gmail or gmail-affiliated credentials). Follow the setup instructions to get Google Drive installed on your phone and ready to handle the transfer of the audio files: http://tiny.cc/digitalarc-upload

*Make sure to track storage on your phones.* Not all of us will have unlimited space on our phones so you may need to periodically stop in-between oral history interviews to upload audio files, even if you have a line of people waiting to be interviewed. You can explain to the contributor and the guide that you need a moment to upload. VERIFY that all the audio files uploaded fully before you delete recordings from your phone, especially if you need to make space.

*Make sure to track the battery usage on your phone.*
