# Site Name and Authors

In your `_config.yml`, you'll see a reference to the site name and author.

Most of the files you create will be "authored" by your community-archive group.

The first field, `author`, is a short-hand computer-friendly nickname for your group. It shouldn't have any spaces or special characters

The second field, `authorname`, is the name that displays to your public audiences. If you have a quote character (") in your group name, that can cause problems because the author name itself is surrounded by quotes. Either change the quote in your author name to a single apostrophe ('), or change the double-quote characters around the whole authorname field to single apostrophes.

	author: "YourGroupNickName"
	authorname : "Kalani Craig"
