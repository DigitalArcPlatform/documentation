# Photographs of Objects and Documents

Once an Item Text File exists, you can add photos to match.

***Before you start***: Make sure your photo files are [named properly first]({{ site.baseurl }}//docs/postEvent/naming/#how-to-name-photos). It's hard to rename photos using Github's web-based editing system.

1. Open the `assets` folder in your Github repo.
1. Open the `items` folder in that `assets` folder.

1. Drag the files you want to upload into the "Drag files" area.
1. Press the "Commit changes" button.
1. In the pop-up window, press the "Commit changes" button again.

## Adding more than one photo

If you have several photos, make sure the photo you want to use as the main photo in the list is the first photo listed in the `assets/items/` folder.
