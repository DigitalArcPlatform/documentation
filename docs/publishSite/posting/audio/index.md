# Audio

If you plan to include audio interviews with a contribution in your collection, the process is very similar to naming and uploading photos.

***Before you start***: Make sure your audio and transcript files are named properly first.

- The audio file needs to be named `itemnumber.mp3`.
- If there's an accompanying transcript, it should be a Word doc file (with a `.docx` extension) and should be named `itemnumber_Transcript.docx`.
- *Example:* For an item named `2023-10-14-0001`, your audio file would be named `2023-10-14-0001.mp3` and the text version of the transcript would be named `2023-10-14-0001_Transcript.docx`.

To upload audio and transcript files: 
1. Open the `assets` folder in your Github repo.
1. Open the `transcripts` folder in that `assets` folder.
