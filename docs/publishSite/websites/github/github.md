# What is Github? 

Like Google Drive or iCloud, Github offers a free place to store files online and collaborate on their contents. The difference is that Github is especially good at storing the files that run computer-oriented projects, and at tracking the individual lines of a file, so that many people can make changes to single document and have all of their changes preserved.

Github also offers a built-in place to built web sites using static-site content management systems.

That makes Github a great place to host websites for free.
